Create a new command using the `alias` command.

For example :

Create an alias for `ls -al` command this way :

`$ alias more='ls -al'`


You can now call `more` just like it was a regular UNIX command.

>Calling alias without any option will list all the aliases defined.

The alias will work until the terminal session is closed.
