cd means Change Directory.
Use cd to move into your directory of choice. 

Typing 

> ## `~$ cd my-project `

gets you inside the **my-project** directory.



> ## `~/my-project$ `

Now you are into the **my-project** directory.

Use the .. special path indicator like this

> ## `~/my-project$ cd .. `

to go back to the parent directory.
