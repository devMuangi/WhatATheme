Move files around using the mv command by specifying the file current path,and it's new path:

`~$ mv project new-project`

The project file is now moved to new-project.

>This is how mv is used to rename files and folders.


If the last parameter is a folder,the file located at the first parameter path is going to be moved into that folder.

Multiple files can be moved into a folder as shown:

`~$ mv project old-project new-project`

project and old-project files will be moved into the new-project directory.
