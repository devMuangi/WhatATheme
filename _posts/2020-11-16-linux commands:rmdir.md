Delete directories/folders using rmdir command.

`~$ rmdir project `

will delete the project directory.

The directory must be empty.

To delete a directory that has files in them,use the rm command which uses the -rf options.


`~$ rm -rf project `


Be careful this command does not ask for confirmation and it will immediatelly remove anything you ask it to.

There is no bin when removing files from the command line.Recovering them can be hard.
