man command is used to understand other commands.

Everytime I'am not sure what a command does,I type :


> ## `~$ man <command> `

and the shell brings up the manual of the command.
is also a very useful resource when you want to learn about a command faster.

Install the command by following instaructions on their 
[official website ](https://tldr.sh/){:target="blank"}  and then run it like this :

> ## `~$ tldr <command> `

to get a quick overview of the command.

The good thing about tldr is that it gives you common use cases of the command unlike man.

tldr is not a replacement of man though.
