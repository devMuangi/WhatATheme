The `man` command is used to understand other commands.

Everytime I'am not sure what a command does,I type :


`~$ man <command> `

and the shell brings up the manual of the command.

[tldr](https://tldr.sh/){:target="blank"} is a very useful resource when you want to learn about a command faster.

Install the command by following instaructions on their 
[official website ](https://tldr.sh/){:target="blank"}  and then run it like this :

`~$ tldr <command> `

to get a quick overview of the command.

The good thing about tldr is that it gives you common use cases of the command unlike man.

tldr is not a replacement of man though.
